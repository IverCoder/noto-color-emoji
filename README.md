# Noto Color Emoji systemless installer

## Features

- Tested: **Brick-free Guarantee!â„¢**

- Maintenance: actively maintained to ensure that emoji updates can propagate through the rooted Android ecosystem as fast as possible.

- Compatibility: this module will also replace the emojis of the following OEMs/carriers:
  - Samsung

  - HTC
  
  - Sony Xperia

  - Docomo

  - More coming soon

## Installation

This module **must not** be installed on devices running Android 12 or later. Font implementation has changed, allowing Google *and* your OEM to update fonts without software updates. Installing this module on such systems is unnecessary will do more harm than good. See [here](https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/custom-font-fallback) for more info.

Simply install this like any other module or flash the .ZIP on TWRP (it will still be systemlessly installed).
