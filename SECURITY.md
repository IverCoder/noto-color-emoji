# Security Policy

## Regarding possible security risks

While this module isn't supposed to modify any sensitive system files and introduce securtiy risks, any Magisk module can introduce security risks as they deal with sensitive partitions (especially /system). A possible way of attack is via the customize.sh fileâ€”it might be used to infiltrate the installation process. If you ever find a way to do so, don't hesitate to open an issue.
